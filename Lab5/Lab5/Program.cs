    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            /*
                public double getArea(double hight, double width)
                {
                    return hight * width;
                }

                the scope defines how visible the code is to the rest of the program
                the scope in this example is "public"

                static means a class can be called with all of its variables already defined
                a non static class will need variables to be restated if called

                the return type determines what the data in the code is
                in this example, the return type is a double

                the identifier is a unique name given to a method so that it can be called later in the code
                the identifier of this code is "getArea"

                the parameters tell the method what kind of data and in what order to expect
                the parameters here are "double hight" and "double width"

                the method body is the instructions on what to do with the data it gets
                the body of this example tells it to multiply the hight and width

                the difference between user-defined methods and framework methods are that one is created by a user for whatever it is they need, while framework methods are built in and cannot be changed
                framework methods should be considered so you do not accidentally create a method under the same identifier
